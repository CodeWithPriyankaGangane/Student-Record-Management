# Student-Record-Management
The Student Record Management System is a console-based application built using Hibernate, which provides a seamless way to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data stored in a relational database.
The project demonstrates how Hibernate simplifies interaction with databases using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). The system allows users to add, view, update, and delete student records efficiently while keeping the codebase clean and decoupled from direct SQL queries.

ðŸ§© Features:
1.Add New Student Record
*Accepts details like ID, Name, Email, Course, and Marks.
*Persists data using Hibernate's session and transaction.
2.View All Students
*Fetches and displays all records from the database.
3.Update Marks by Student ID
*Searches for a student by ID and updates their marks.
4.Delete Student Record
*Deletes a student record by specifying the student ID.

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives:
Understand the basics of Hibernate ORM and how to integrate it with a Java application.
Perform all CRUD operations using Hibernate methods.
Learn how to configure hibernate.cfg.xml and entity class annotations (@Entity, @Id, etc.).
Gain experience in handling Session, Transaction, and Query objects.

âœ… Outcomes:
By completing this project, you will have a solid understanding of:
*Hibernate configuration and mapping
*Performing real-world CRUD operations
*Writing reusable DAO (Data Access Object) classes
*Managing database sessions and transactions
